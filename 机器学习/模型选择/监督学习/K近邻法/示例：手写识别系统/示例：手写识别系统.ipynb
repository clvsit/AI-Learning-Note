    "## 示例：手写识别系统\n",
    "本节构造使用 K-近邻分类器的手写识别系统。简单起见，构造的系统只能识别数字 0 到 9。需要识别的数字已经使用图形处理软件，处理成具有相同的色彩和大小：宽高是 32 像素 X 32 像素的黑白图像。尽管**采用文本格式存储图像不能有效地利用内存空间**，但为了方便理解，还是将图像转换为文本格式。\n",
    "\n",
    "【步骤】：\n",
    "- 收集数据：提供文本文件；\n",
    "- 准备数据：编写函数 img2vector，将图像格式转换为分类器使用的向量格式；\n",
    "- 分析数据：检查数据，确保符合要求；\n",
    "- 测试算法：编写函数使用提供的部分数据集作为测试样本，测试样本与非测试样本的区别在于测试样本是已经完成分类的数据，如果预测分类与实际类别不同，则标记为一个错误。"
